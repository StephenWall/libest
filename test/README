This directory contains the unit test code for verifying libest.
The unit test code utilizes CUnit and libcurl.  Be warned that
this directory is not integrated with the libest autoconf
configuration.  You'll need to manually ensure the CUnit and libcurl
dependencies are working properly on your host.  The following
versions are known to work:

CUnit 2.1.2
libcurl 7.31.0

To use the unit test, descend into the the UT directory and issue
the 'make' command.  If your host meets the dependencies, the target
'runtest' should be built.  Running this from the command line
should run all the unit tests.  The OpenSSL libraries and libest
should be in your shared library path (LD_LIBRARY_PATH) prior to
running the unit tests.

Some tests require that 'localhost.cisco.com' be resolvable.  You
can accommodate this by placing this line in your system's hosts
file:

127.0.0.1       localhost.cisco.com

This file is located in /etc/hosts on *nix-like systems, in
C:\Windows\System32\Drivers\etc\hosts on Windows, and in
/private/etc/hosts on Mac OS X 10.6 to 10.12.
